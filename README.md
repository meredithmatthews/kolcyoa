Ultimately, WordPress is a tool for publishing stories, right? I’m trying to explore how to use WordPress to tell stories. WordPress backend interfaces and dashboards are extremely personal and intimate spaces, and as far as I can tell, largely unexplored as a medium.

I’ve created this plugin to test a “choose your own adventure” story in a dashboard widget using a simple switch statement and query strings. I borrowed the story from a Kingdom of Loathing PDF, which can be found <a href ="http://images.kingdomofloathing.com/cyoa/">here</a>.
